LV2-C++-TOOLS
=============
This software package contains libraries and programs that should make 
it easier to write LV2 plugins. You can generate HTML API 
documentation by running 'doxygen' in the top level of the source 
tree.

To build and install, run

 ./configure
 make
 su -c 'make install'

You can pass some options to configure, e.g. --prefix=/usr to install
everything in /usr (the default is /usr/local).
