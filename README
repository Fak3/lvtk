LV2 C++ Libs (liblv2mm)
=======================

The name of this package is subject to change. Awaiting approval from
[LAD] that lv2mm is appropriate.

This software package contains libraries that wrap the LV2 C API and
extensions into easy to use C++ classes. The original work for this
was mostly done by Lars Luthman in lv2-c++-tools.
