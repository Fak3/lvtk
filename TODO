Before 1.1:

 [X] Make lv2peg use Redland tools instead of PAQ
 [X] Move PAQ to its own package, or one shared with Elven
 [ ] Deprecate lv2soname, ELF libraries can say themselves
     whether they can be unloaded or not
 [ ] Deprecate the old GUI extension

Possibly before 1.1:

 [ ] Add support for an LV2r3-conforming GUI extension

Before 2.0:

 [ ] Remove lv2soname
 [ ] Remove support for the old GUI extension
 [ ] C++[01]x rewrite, just for the hell of it, and because the
     template classes could be made vastly more readable with
     some type deduction and variadic templates
