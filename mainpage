/** @mainpage LV2 C++ classes
    These documents describes some C++ classes that may be of use if you want
    to write LV2 plugins in C++. They implement most of the boilerplate code
    so you only have to write the parts that matter, and hide the low-level
    C API.
    
    The classes are separated into two libraries. One, called liblv2-plugin,
    contains the class LV2::Plugin, defined in the file lv2plugin.hpp. It
    is a base class that you can inherit in order to create new LV2 plugins.
    The other library, called liblv2-gui, contains the classes LV2::Controller
    and LV2::GUI, defined in the file lv2gui.hpp, which you can use in a 
    similar way to create new LV2 plugin GUIs.
