/** @mainpage liblv2-plugin and liblv2-gui - API documentation
    These documents describes some C++ classes that may be of use if you want
    to write LV2 plugins in C++. They implement most of the boilerplate code
    so you only have to write the parts that matter, and hide the low-level
    C API.
    
    The classes are separated into two libraries. One, called liblv2-plugin,
    contains the classes LV2::Plugin and LV2::Synth, defined in the files 
    lv2plugin.hpp and lv2synth.hpp. They are base classes that you can inherit
    in order to create new LV2 plugins. The other library, called liblv2-gui, 
    contains the class LV2::GUI, defined in the file lv2gui.hpp, which you can
    use in a similar way to create new LV2 plugin GUIs.
    
    For both the Plugin and the GUI class there are other helper classes called
    @ref pluginmixins "mixins" that you can use to add extra functionality to 
    your plugins, for example support for LV2 extensions.

    These libraries are only available as static libraries (and most of the
    code is template classes in header files), thus ABI stability is not an 
    issue. The API will be stable between major version bumps, at which the
    pkg-config name would change to prevent plugins from building against an
    incompatible version, but if you were to modify the build system to create
    shared libraries and link against those you are on your own.
    
    This is reference documentation, if you want a more tutorial-type document
    you can have a look at <a href="http://ll-plugins.nongnu.org/lv2pftci">
    LV2 programming for the complete idiot</a>.
